# weatherApp

## About this Project
This is an application built using **Nuxt 3**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. The app allows users to:

- Search for a city to view its weather information.
- Save or remove cities from their saved list.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. City Save State
The "Save Location" button didnâ€™t update its state when a city was already saved.  
**Solution:** Added a computed property to check if the city exists in the saved cities list, ensuring the button state updated reactively.

### 2. Due to OpenWeather's limitations
Due to OpenWeather's limitations, I couldn't show today's weather if the time had already passed.
**Solution:** I put in a condition so that when there is no more data to show for the current day, it shows the next one.
